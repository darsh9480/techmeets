<h1 class="head" id="05">What is Artificial Intelligence ?</h1>
 <image src="AI/001.png" align="right" height="400px" width="700px" style="border: 5px solid black">
<p class="text1">AI as a concept refers to computing hardware being able to essentially think for itself, and make decisions based on the data it is being fed.
 AI systems are often hugely complex and powerful, with the ability to process unfathomable depths of information in an extremely quick time in order to come to an 
 effective conclusion.<br>
Thanks to detailed algorithms, AI systems are now able to perform mammoth computing tasks much faster and more efficiently than human minds, helping making big strides in research
and development areas around the world.<br>
Some of the most notable real-world applications of AI are IBM's Watson, which is being used to power research in a huge range of fields,  with Microsoft's Azure Machine 
Learning and TensorFlow also making headlines around the world.<br>
But AI-powered smart assistants are becoming a common presence on mobile devices too, with the likes of Siri, Cortana and Alexa all being welcomed into many people's lives.
There seems no limit to the applications of AI technologies, and perhaps the most exciting aspect of the ecosystem is that there's no telling where it can go next, and what problems
it may ultimately be able to solve.

<p class="text1" style="color:crimson">Artificial Intelligence (AI) is brining a drastic changes in technological fields, where it can be implemented to automate the system for more efficiency and
 performance. AI is now getting used in multiple fields from simply your mobile phone to diagnosing the diseases providing a high-performance and accurate system work with efficiency.
Here we will discuss what are major things and fields AI is used and under process to get fully implemented and launched in up coming years. Here we will discuss mainly about the 
fields or industries where AI is playing an important role helping humans to work with better performance and efficiency without help of humans.

<p class="text1" style="color:white">Back in the 1800s, AI was limited in myths, fiction, and speculation. Classical philosophers envisioned machines integrated into human beings. However, 
they were just portrayed in fiction work like Mary Shelly’s “Frankenstein” then. The real initiation in AI began in 1956. The seed that led towards an AI future was a workshop 
in Darthmod College, attendees of which were claimed as AI leaders for decades to come. 

The AI surge began with six major design goals as follows:
<ol class="text1" style="color:white">
<li>Teach machines to reason in accordance to perform sophisticated mental tasks like playing chess, proving mathematical theorems, and others.</li>
<li>Knowledge representation for machines to interact with the real world as humans do — machines needed to be able to identify objects, people, and languages. </li>
<li>Programming language Lisp was developed for this very purpose.</li>
<li>Teach machines to plan and navigate around the world we live in. With this, machines could autonomously move around by navigating themselves.</li>
<li>Enable machines to process natural language so that they can understand language, conversations and the context of speech.</li>
<li>Train machines to perceive the way humans do- touch, feel, sight, hearing, and taste.</li>
<li>General Intelligence that included emotional intelligence, intuition, and creativity.</li>
</ol>
