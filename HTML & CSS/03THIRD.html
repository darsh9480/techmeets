<p class="text1" style="color:#8005b0">According to the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA), graphic design is defined as “the art and practice of planning and projecting ideas and experiences 
with visual and textual content.” In other terms, graphic design communicates certain ideas or messages in a visual way. These visuals can be as simple as a business logo, or as 
complex as page layouts on a website.<br><br>
Graphic design can be used by companies to promote and sell products through advertising, by websites to convey complicated information in a digestible way through infographics, or by businesses 
to develop an identity through branding, among other things.<br><br>
It’s also important to remember that although many graphic design projects have commercial purposes like advertisements and logos, it is also used in other contexts and graphic design work 
is often created purely as a means for artistic expression.

<p class="text1">
To better understand the meaning of graphic design, it is important to be aware of the elements and principles that make up design. Elements are used in conjunction or 
opposition with each other to create visually striking and impactful designs.

These graphic design elements include:
<ul>
<li class="text1" style="color:#e60000">Color</li>
<li class="text1" style="color:#e60000">Form</li>
<li class="text1" style="color:#e60000">Line</li>
<li class="text1" style="color:#e60000">Shape</li>
<li class="text1" style="color:#e60000">Size</li>
<li class="text1" style="color:#e60000">Space</li>
<li class="text1" style="color:#e60000">Texture</li>
</ul><p class="text1">
Graphic designers also adhere to the principles of design, which are essentially a set of guidelines that help a design achieve effective composition. These basic principles 
aid in creating balance and stability for the piece of work.

These graphic design principles include:</p>
<ul>
<li class="text1" style="color:#e60000">Balance</li>
<li class="text1" style="color:#e60000">Contrast</li>
<li class="text1" style="color:#e60000">Emphasis</li>
<li class="text1" style="color:#e60000">Movement</li>
<li class="text1" style="color:#e60000">Proportion</li>
<li class="text1" style="color:#e60000">Rhythm</li>
</ul><p class="text1">
You’ve heard the old saying that “rules are meant to be broken,” which can certainly ring true in this case. But a good graphic designer must first understand these 
principles before making the conscious decision to break them.</p>

As mentioned earlier, there is no single graphic design meaning. Graphic design is composed of many fields and specializations, ranging from print and web design to animation and motion graphics. Graphic design offers opportunities and options for individuals of almost any interest.

If you’d asked someone 30 years ago to define graphic design, their answer would have likely been focused on print-related examples like magazines, movie posters and advertisements. Now we’re living in the digital age, which has given birth to several new types of graphic design.

Some of the most notable modern-day graphic design examples stem from advancements in technology. Here’s a glimpse of some of these types of graphic design:




<ul class="text1" style="color: #ff9966">
<li>Website design involves creating engaging and intuitive web pages for users. This includes overall layout, color scheme and navigation.</li>
<li>User experience (UX) design is focused on ensuring a website or application is easy and satisfying to use. These designers emphasize value, usability, adoptability and 
desirability.</li>
<li>Motion graphics design—or animation—brings visual elements to life through special effects, TV shows, video games and movies.</li>
</ul>

<p class="text1" style="color:white">
With technological advancements introducing new types of graphic design, there has also been an emergence of new graphic design jobs. This evolution has changed the entire 
landscape of careers in this field.

Demand for “traditional” graphic designers who work primarily for print publishers has fallen substantially, but that doesn’t tell the whole story. Employment of graphic 
designers in computer systems design services is projected to grow by 24 percent through 2028, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).1 Much of this demand is spurred by business’ and organizations’ increased need for digital graphics and imagery as they aim to increase their digital presence.

So with that said, what are some common graphic design job titles?
 We analyzed more than 30,000 job postings calling for a graphic design degree over the past year.2 The data helped us determine the most common job titles:

<ol class="text1" style="color:white">
<li>Graphic designer</li>
<li>User experience (UX) designer </li>
<li>Web designer</li>
<li>Art director</li>
<li>ECreative director</li>
</ol>
<p class="text1" style="color:white">
As you can see, once armed with the proper knowledge and training, there are several graphic design job options out there. You have the ability to cater your career to
your personal skills and interests.

Now that you know what type of jobs and specializations are out there, it’s helpful to familiarize yourself with the graphic design tools that help get the job done. 
One of the most basic, and least expensive, tools designers use is a sketchbook. Graphic designers will often sketch out ideas or rough drafts on paper before turning to 
a computer to complete the process.
<br><br>
That being said, computers and design software are essentials in today’s digital climate, even if you are designing for print. The type of computer you need is based on 
preference, but when it comes to software, Adobe products such as Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign are mainstays in the graphic design world. If you are just beginning 
and don’t want to commit to the high price tag Adobe products often carry, similar free open-source software such as <b>GIMP</b> can help you begin to master the basics.
<br><br>
Lastly, ideas and inspiration are what a graphic designer needs most. “You need to have a solid concept serving as the foundation of your design and communication,”
 explains Chad Birenbaum, co-founder of <b> Duckpin Design</b>. “This concept and idea needs to work on paper first and then the computer should be used as a tool to bring the
 concept to life.”
