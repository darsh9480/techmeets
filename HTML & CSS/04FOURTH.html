<h1 class="head" id="05" style="text-shadow: 20px 20px 20px hotpink, 0 0 25px hotpink, 0 0 10px hotpink;">What is 3D Printing ?</h1>
 <image src="3d/001.jpg" align="right" height="255px" width="700px" style="border: 5px solid black;">
<p class="text1" align="left">3D printing refers to a variety of processes in which a computer-operated machine creates three-dimensional objects by joining or solidifying material, typically 
layer-by-layer until the whole object is complete. 3D printing is also commonly referred to as additive manufacturing.
<br>Even though the early years of the technology seemed to regard 3D printing as an expensive process only suitable for aesthetical prototypes, the technology behind additive
 3D printing has evolved to an impressive scale in the last few years, lowering barriers and making it more popular and affordable to end-users.

<h1 class="head" style="text-shadow: 20px 20px 20px gold, 0 0 25px gold, 0 0 10px gold;" id="04">How does 3D printing work?</h1>
<image src="3d/002.jpg" align="right" height="255px" width="500px" style="border: 5px solid black;">
<p class="text1" style="color:crimson">Every 3D printer builds parts based on the same main principle: a digital model is turned into a physical three-dimensional object by adding 
material a layer at a time. This where the alternative term Additive Manufacturing comes from.
<br>
3D printing is a fundamentally different way of producing parts compared to traditional subtractive (CNC machining) or formative (Injection molding) manufacturing technologies.
<br>
In 3D printing, no special tools are required (for example, a cutting tool with certain geometry or a mold). Instead the part is manufactured directly onto the built platform 
layer-by-layer, which leads to a unique set of benefits and limitations - <br>
The process always begins with a digital 3D model - the blueprint of the physical object. This model is sliced by the printer's software into thin, 2-dimensional layers and 
then turned into a set of instructions in machine language (G-code) for the printer to execute.
<br>
From here, the way a 3D printer works varies by process. For example, desktop FDM printers melt plastic filaments and lay it down onto the print platform through a nozzle
 (like a high-precision, computer-controlled glue gun). Large industrial SLS machines use a laser to melt (or sinter) thin layers of metal or plastic powders.
<br>
The available materials also vary by process. Plastics are by far the most common, but metals can also be 3D printed. The produced parts can also have a wide range of 
specific physical properties, ranging from optically clear to rubber-like objects.
<br>
Depending on the size of the part and the type of printer, a print usually takes about 4 to 18 hours to complete. 3D printed parts are rarely ready-to-use out of the machine though. They often require some post-processing to achieve the desired level of surface finish. These steps take additional time and (usually manual) effort.

<ul class="text1" style="color: #ff9966">
<li>The sci-fi author, Arthur C. Clarke, was the first to describe the basic functions of a 3D printer back in 1964.</li>
<li>The first 3D printer was released in 1987 by Chuck Hull of 3D Systems and it was using the "stereolithography" (SLA) process.</li>
<li>In the 90's and 00's other 3D printing technologies were released, including FDM by Stratasys and SLS by 3D Systems. These printers 
were expensive and mainly used for industrial prototyping.</li>
<li>In 2009, the ASTM Committee F42 published a document containing the standard terminology on Additive Manufacturing. This established 3D printing as an industrial 
manufacturing technology.</li>
<li>In the same year, the patents on FDM expired and the first low-cost, desktop 3D printers were born by the RepRap project. What once cost $200,000, suddenly became 
available for below $2,000.</li>
<li>According to Wohlers the adoption of 3D printing keeps growing: more than 1 million desktop 3D printers were sold globally between 2015 and 2017 and the sales of 
industrial metal printers almost doubled in 2017 compared to the previous year.</li>

<p class="text1" style="color:#00b300">
3D printing is an exceptional tool for manufacturing custom parts and prototyping. Due to its unique characteristics though, it is best suited for specific applications.

When choosing between an additive (3D printing), subtractive (CNC machining) or formative (Injection Molding) manufacturing technology, there are a few simple guidelines to follow.

As a rule of thumb:

"3D printing is the best option when a single (or only a few) parts are required at a quick turnaround time and a low-cost or when the part geometry cannot be produced with any other manufacturing technology."
Choosing a subtractive technology (CNC machining) makes more sense in the following scenarios:
<br>
<ul>
<li class="text1" style="color:#ff6600">Medium volumes: When producing parts in the 100's, then CNC machining is typically more economical. This is because the economies of scale start to kick in.</li>
<li class="text1" style="color:#ff6600">Relatively simple geometries: Especially for metal parts, when the design can be manufactured easily through a subtractive process then CNC machining is the best option.</li>
<li class="text1" style="color:#ff6600">High material requirements: When excellent material properties are essential, then CNC machining is a better option, as 3D printed parts typically have a lower strength.</li>
<li class="text1" style="color:#ff6600">High dimensional accuracy: For functional parts with tight tolerances, CNC machining is the best option. For complex geometries, a hybrid approach (print first, CNC machine
 afterwards) is also be a viable option.</li>
 <br>
 <p class="text1" style="color:#00b300">
For larger production (> 1000 parts), formative technologies (like Injection molding) are more cost effective and usually make the most financial sense.
<br>
For a quick reference in the unit cost, use the graph below. In this simplification, it was assumed that all technologies can produce the part geometry. When this is not 
the case, 3D printing is generally the preferred manufacturing solution.
