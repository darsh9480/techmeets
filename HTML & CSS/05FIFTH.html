    <td class="tab">Creating New Jobs</td>
	<td class="tab">“Artificial intelligence will change the workforce,” affirms Carolyn Frantz, Microsoft’s Corporate Secretary. The bleak view of AI as a job killer is but one side of the coin: while 75 million jobs may disappear, as many as 133 million more engaging, less repetitive new roles are expected to be created. AI “is an opportunity for workers to focus on the parts of their jobs that may also be the most satisfying to them,” says Frantz. </td>

    <td class="tab">Bridging Language Divides</td>
	<td class="tab">Whether it’s teaching new languages in a personalized way or translating speech and text in real-time, AI-powered language tools from Duolingo to Skype are bridging social and cultural divides in our workplaces, classrooms and everyday lives. Digital translation services are not “perfect,” admits Microsoft education leader Mark Sparvell, but “they offer a means of understanding” that might not otherwise be possible.</td>

    <td class="tab">Transforming Government</td>
	<td class="tab">Less paperwork, quicker responses, a more efficient bureaucracy – AI has the power to drastically change public administration, but are governments ready? This tech comes with both risks and opportunities that need to be understood and evaluated. Academic Kevin Desouza believes gamification and role-playing could be the key to public servants analyzing complex cases, coming up with better solutions, and truly understanding the future of autonomous systems.</td>

Babylon, an app that offers symptom checking and fast access to physicians if needed, is providing advice to more than one million residents in central London through an AI-powered chatbot. Patients can get an accurate, safe, and convenient answer in seconds – and save health care providers’ money too.</td>

  <tr class="tab1">
    <td class="tab1">Supporting the fight against hunger and homelessness</td>
	<td class="tab1">3D printing is being explored as a major solution for current and future levels of hunger and homelessness. For example, Anjan Contractor hopes that one day, his 3D food printer will be able to empower the earth’s population to feed themselves “customized, nutritionally-appropriate meals synthesized one layer at a time, from cartridges of powder and oils they buy at the corner grocery store.” These cartridges would be easy to transport, long-lasting, and could be made of sustainable materials like insect protein. 3D printing is also revolutionizing home construction, making it cheaper and more efficient.</td>

    <td class="tab1">Transforming humanitarian response and modern medicine</td>
	<td class="tab1">3D printing also is being used to get essential goods and services to disaster areas and refugee camps, allowing workers and stakeholders to have access to the tools they need to recover. For example, in Nepal, the United Nations is implementing 3D printing as part of their plan for earthquake response, including printing customized pipe parts necessary for sanitation infrastructure. 3D printing is also enabling new and essential medical tools to get into the hands of people who need them, from medical possibilities like an 3D printed artificial heart to basic tools like umbilical cord clips.</td>

  <tr class="tab1">
    <td class="tab1">Protecting our planet</td>
	<td class="tab1">3D printing is also allowing us to use old materials in new ways that are more sustainable. For example, researchers have figured out how to convert carbon dioxide into concrete using 3D printing. Utilizing former waste to create future products makes our society have more efficient consumption. 3D printing innovators are even exploring how to make the process itself more sustainable, including using algae based filaments to reduce the energy necessitated for the printing process. The creative use of materials and production methods opens up new possibilities as we approach climate action and sustainable living.</td>

  <tr class="tab2">
    <td class="tab2">Complex Problems</td>
	<td class="tab2">Because today’s world is made up of interdependent systems and communities, change in one area affects other areas. Design must manage that complexity and maintain user experience as paramount. Work at this level requires interdisciplinary collaboration and continuous updating to ensure the best possible outcomes.</td>

    <td class="tab2">Bridging Digital and Physical Experiences</td>
    <td class="tab2">This is one I’ve talked about a lot lately. Nearly 80% of American workers are in the service industry, and 70% of consumers prefer an online, self-service option when engaging with businesses and organizations. Consumers typically visit multiple channels before completing purchases (social, web, retail, customer service chat). If retailers can translate physical products and activities into service opportunities, and if they can meet a customer with service first, on every brand application, they will be more successful.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="tab2">
	<td class="tab2">Core Values Matter</td>
    <td class="tab2">People care. Isn’t that actually so lovely? Consumers favor and develop long-term relationships with businesses and organizations that share their values. They no longer want hard sell or cleverness in communications. Authenticity and transparency are key. Organizations must know their brand foundation and see that their values are evidenced out in every touchpoint.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="tab2">
	<td class="tab2">Making Sense in the Data Economy</td>
	<td class="tab2">Big brother, indeed. Smart, connected products are transforming competition in today’s business and also creating entirely new industries. They collect data about the environment, users, and usage. The best systems adapt and learn from the user’s behavior. Designers and brands must think in terms of adaptive technological systems that learn and evolve. Fixed features and functions are the past, and design solutions that use prototyping artificial intelligence are the future.</td>
